USAGE
    fetchtweet 
        Reads from ~/.rfc5322.yaml
    
    sendtweet [--account string] [status]
        You can also pipe an email into this. 
        The relevant headers are:
            From (the account to use)
            Subject (the tweet)
        
        The body can also be used for the tweet, but the subject takes 
        precedence
        
        --account defaults to the first account in the config file
    
    ~/.rfc5322.yaml
    Simplest config file is:
        ---
        :accounts: 
          :accountname: 
            :maildir: /path/to/maildir
    
AUTHENTICATION
    Run either fetchtweet and it will take you through the authentication 
    process for each account in the config file. This is a one time only thing.
    
    NOTE: lib/outh_key.rb
    I am currently not too sure how to deal with the ouath consumer secrets 
    security, so currently you need to edit this with your own app registration
